                <div class="service">
                    <h3>Enhanced Performance</h3>
                    <p>MPLS minimizes latency and packet loss by establishing predictable, low-latency paths for data transmission. This results in improved application performance and user experience.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service">
                    <h3>Traffic Engineering</h3>
                    <p>By using traffic engineering capabilities, MPLS allows network administrators to prioritize traffic based on application requirements. This ensures that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth and quality of service (QoS).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service">
                    <h3>Scalability</h3>
                    <p>MPLS networks are highly scalable, making them suitable for businesses experiencing growth or requiring seamless connectivity across multiple locations. Whether you have a few sites or a global network, MPLS can accommodate your needs.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service">
                    <h3>Security</h3>
                    <p>MPLS inherently provides a higher level of security compared to traditional IP-based networks. With built-in traffic separation and encryption options, MPLS helps protect sensitive data and ensures compliance with industry regulations.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service">
                    <h3>Simplified Management</h3>
